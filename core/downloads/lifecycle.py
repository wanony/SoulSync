"""Batch lifecycle: start workers, on-completion accounting, completion check.

Three deeply-coupled functions:

- `start_next_batch_of_downloads(batch_id, deps)` — launches workers up to
  the batch's max_concurrent. Skips cancelled tasks, sets searching status,
  submits to the executor, decrement-safe on submit failures (no ghost
  workers).

- `on_download_completed(batch_id, task_id, success, deps)` — called when
  a single track download finishes (good or bad). Tracks failed/cancelled
  tracks for wishlist replay, decrements active count, then runs the full
  batch-completion check — which is its own beast: stuck-task detection
  (searching > 10min → not_found, post_processing > 5min → completed),
  M3U regeneration, repair worker hand-off, album consistency pass,
  wishlist failed-tracks processing.

- `check_batch_completion_v2(batch_id, deps)` — same completion check
  but called from the V2 atomic cancel path (which bypasses
  on_download_completed). Duplicate logic preserved verbatim.

Lifted verbatim from web_server.py. Dependencies injected via
`LifecycleDeps` since the surface is wide (15+ callbacks/refs).

    - The app crashed mid-bundle (cleanup never fired).
