"""Per-task download worker.

Runs as a background thread (one per task) that:
1. Tries source-reuse (use the batch's last good slskd peer if available)
2. Tries staging-match (file already in staging folder, no download needed)
3. Generates smart search queries via the matching engine + legacy fallbacks
4. Iterates queries sequentially against the soulseek client
5. For each query: validates results, attempts download with fallback candidates
6. If hybrid mode: falls back to remaining sources (youtube/tidal/qobuz/hifi/deezer_dl)
7. On total failure: marks task not_found + records search diagnostics
8. On any uncaught exception: marks failed + emergency worker-slot recovery

Lifted verbatim from web_server.py's `_download_track_worker`. The helpers
this calls into (try_source_reuse, store_batch_source, try_staging_match,
get_valid_candidates, attempt_download_with_candidates, on_download_completed,
recover_worker_slot) are passed via `TaskWorkerDeps` since each is itself
a large web_server.py helper that will get its own lift in subsequent PRs.

    """Return a user-facing miss reason when per-track search should stop.

    Torrent / usenet album batches first download one private staged release,
    then each track claims the matching staged file. If that claim fails after
    the release is already staged, falling through to the normal per-track
    search only retries release-level sources N times and can keep re-adding
    the same torrent/NZB. For those two sources we treat the staged release as
    authoritative for this pass.

    Soulseek is deliberately NOT short-circuited. A Soulseek album bundle stages
    whichever single folder scored best, and ``album_bundle_partial`` only
    reflects whether the files found IN that folder downloaded — not whether the
    folder actually contained every track the album needs. So a track the album
    needs but that wasn't in the chosen folder would otherwise be marked
    not_found with no fallback (#743). Unlike torrent/usenet, Soulseek per-track
    search is a genuine per-file network search — it doesn't re-add a release —
    so letting these misses fall through to the normal per-track flow (and, in
    hybrid mode, onward to the next source) is correct and cheap.
